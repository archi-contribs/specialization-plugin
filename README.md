# specialization-plugin
The specialization plugin is designed to specialize concepts (figures, icons, etc.) inside Archi **up to version 4.8**.

As **Archi 4.9** natively includes specialization, this plugin won't be maintained anymore. it can be considered as **deprecated**.

Icons and labels of Archi components can be replaced in a view and/or the model tree. This is done by configuring the properties of Archi elements. 

This plugin is compatible with all my other plugins and with the GitHub persistence plugin. Archi users who open a model, but don't have the specialization images or plugin will just see the standard icons.

For more information about how to use the plugin and additional configuration details, please see the wiki.
