<br>
When an element is selected in a view, a new "Drill down" tab is shown in the properties window.<br>
<br>
When a view is selected as drill down, this view will be opened when the user double clicks on the view element.<br>
<br>
In fact, selecting a view leads to store the view's internal ID inside the "drill down" property ofthe element. When the user double-clicks on the element, then the view ID is retrieved from the element's properties and opened.<br> 
<br>
To remove the drill down functionality on an element, one may select the empty line in the drill down tab, or delete the "drill down" property of the element.<br>
